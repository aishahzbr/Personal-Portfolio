## My Personal Portfolio

It is a small project that I refer from The Codeholic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNhmEoBsZ48) where I can store my small projects from GitHub. Creating this simple small portfolio makes me more eager and am looking forward to create small projects and upload them on GitHub even more. 

Thank you @thecodeholic !
